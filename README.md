Spotify Info Suite is an information delivery platform for Spotify desktop application users. Our aim is to provide users with an abundance of information about the song, artist and album that they are currently listening to on the Spotify Desktop App. Info Suite will enhance aspects of the Spotify app, such as Bio and Photos, as well as create new features like Lyrics and Reviews. It will fill the information gap left by the Spotify Desktop App’s built-in features that are significantly lacking or simply don’t exist. Such features include Song Lyrics, Lyric Interpretations, Album Reviews, Facts, extended Artist Bio and unlimited Artist Photos. Our superior information will be sourced from specialized databases, aggregated reviews, and curated publications. Simple playback controls will exist on Info Suite for convenience, but the majority of music browsing, such as search, will still be handled by the Spotify Desktop App. Info Suite will always remain in sync with the desktop app, creating an integrated experience for the user. **This is a class project written by Steve Pedersen and Andrew Lesondak at San Francisco State University CSc 690: Interactive Multimedia Application Development**
