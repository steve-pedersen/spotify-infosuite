        "On 29 September 2011, at the Abandon Normal Devices festival, three specially commissioned Forest Swords pieces, as part of a site-specific sound art series called 'Ground Rhythms', were cut to 12\" X-ray film and performed on turntables at an event at Liverpool's Static Gallery. The pieces were inspired by three architectural sites from Merseyside history which no longer exist, and the tracks on the brittle X-ray pressings were designed to be \"played once only before degrading, never to be played again\". The final copy of the X-ray vinyl was sold in December 2013 on eBay, with all proceeds going to the Philippines Typhoon Appeal. A second performance in the series took place at the AV Festival in Newcastle in March 2012, inspired by demolished buildings in the north east.",
